Let\'s explore a few of the most common concerns\n\n00:09.928 --> 00:13.640\na learner in your training might have. Students may be\n\n00:13.680 --> 00:17.032\nresistant to change. They are comfortable with the existing\n\n00:17.096 --> 00:20.500\nsoftware tool and feel the current system is good enough.\n\n00:21.120 --> 00:24.744\nStudents may fear the unknown. Adult learners typically\n\n00:24.792 --> 00:28.610\ndo not like to make mistakes in training and may feel vulnerable.\n\n00:29.030 --> 00:32.686\nLearners may fear breaking something in their database and don\'t\n\n00:32.718 --> 00:36.590\nwant to feel embarrassed. Learning something new can be overwhelming,\n\n00:36.670 --> 00:40.478\nespecially if software and technology is not something they feel confident working\n\n00:40.534 --> 00:45.278\nwith. Students may not see a clear benefit to new software.\n\n00:45.454 --> 00:49.422\nThey may ask how software improves their work. If students don\'t see\n\n00:49.446 --> 00:52.850\nthe value, they are not motivated to learn. In your training.\n\n00:53.740 --> 00:57.620\nStudents may have had past negative experiences learning software.\n\n00:57.780 --> 01:01.220\nAddressing these concerns through clear communication and\n\n01:01.260 --> 01:05.300\nempathizing with your learners can set your training up for success and\n\n01:05.340 --> 01:06.260\nreduce resistance.\n\n"
